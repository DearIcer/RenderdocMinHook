*** DOCUMENTATION ***

The contents of this redist directory is for the express purpose of
allowing licensees of the Nsight Perf SDK to redistribute a portion of
the SDK as they fit. The contents of this directory may change over
time for future releases. At this time, it contains the utility
library and header files to allow compilation.

One example of usage would be that developers (heretofore referred to
as "you") using the Nsight Perf SDK may release their own tool built
on top of this SDK. The files here have their own licensing which you
would redistribute with your tool using whatever mechansim you provide
to release said tool. See section 1.c. for further details should you
wish to redistribute the entire SDK (including binaries).

Otherwise, your users would in turn go to
https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-perf-sdk/get-started to obtain the
latest SDK binaries should they want to in turn utilize the binary as
part of your tool if they are not already a licensee.
